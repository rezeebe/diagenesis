I present a numerical diﬀusion–advection-reaction model to simulate CO 2 chemistry, d 13 C, and oxidation of organic carbon 
and methane in sediment porewater. The model takes into account detailed reaction kinetics of dissolved CO 2 compounds, 
H 2 O, H + , OH-, boron and sulﬁde compounds. These reactions are usually assumed to be in local equilibrium,
which is shown to be a good approximation in most cases. The model also includes a diﬀusive boundary layer across which
chemical species are transported between bottom water and the sediment–water interface.
